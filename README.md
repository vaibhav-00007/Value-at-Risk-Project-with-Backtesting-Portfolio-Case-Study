# Value-at-Risk-Project-with-Backtesting-Portfolio-Case-Study
This project implements Value at Risk (VaR) estimation using three different methods — Historical Simulation, Parametric (Variance-Covariance), and Monte Carlo Simulation. The models are backtested using Kupiec’s Proportion of Failures (POF) Test to assess accuracy.
